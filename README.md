# 1min-relay Cloudflare Worker

![GitHub package.json version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/7a6163/1min-relay-worker)

A TypeScript implementation of the 1min.ai API relay service, designed to run on Cloudflare Workers with distributed rate limiting and accurate token counting.

## Features

- **Complete API Relay**: Full compatibility with 1min.ai chat completions, responses, image generation, and audio transcription/translation endpoints
- **OpenAI Responses API**: Structured outputs with JSON objects, JSON schema, and reasoning effort control
- **Distributed Rate Limiting**: Uses Cloudflare KV for consistent rate limiting across multiple worker instances
- **Accurate Token Counting**: Integrated with `gpt-tokenizer` for precise token calculation across all models
- **Dynamic Model List**: Model data fetched live from the 1min.ai API with two-tier caching (in-memory + KV), always up to date
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time streaming responses for chat completions
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and modern development experience
- **Vision Support**: Supports image input for vision models
- **Audio Transcription & Translation**: OpenAI Whisper-compatible speech-to-text and audio translation endpoints

## Supported Models

Model data is fetched dynamically from the 1min.ai API and cached with a two-tier strategy (in-memory 5 min, KV 1 hr). The `GET /v1/models` endpoint always returns the latest available models. Use it to see the full list:

```bash
curl https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/v1/models
```

Capabilities such as vision, code interpreter, and web search are derived automatically from the API response — no hardcoded model lists.

## API Endpoints

### Chat Completions

```
POST /v1/chat/completions
```

### Responses (Structured Outputs)

```
POST /v1/responses
```

#### Vision Support Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "What do you see in this image?"
          },
          {
            "type": "image_url",
            "image_url": {
              "url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQ..."
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

#### Responses API Examples

The Responses API supports structured outputs and reasoning control. It accepts two input formats:

**Simple Input Format:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "input": "Tell me a three sentence bedtime story about a unicorn.",
    "reasoning_effort": "medium"
  }'
```

**Messages Format (for conversations):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Analyze the pros and cons of remote work"
      }
    ],
    "reasoning_effort": "high"
  }'
```

  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "input": "Analyze the benefits of exercise",
    "response_format": {
      "type": "json_object"
    },
    "reasoning_effort": "high"
  }'
```

**JSON Schema Response:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "input": "Create a user profile for John Doe, age 30, software engineer",
    "response_format": {
      "type": "json_schema",
      "json_schema": {
        "name": "user_profile",
        "description": "A user profile object",
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",

          },
          "required": ["name", "age", "profession"]
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

## Rate Limiting

The worker implements distributed rate limiting with the following limits:

- **Requests per minute**: 180 per IP address
- **Tokens per minute**: 100,000 per IP address

Rate limits are enforced using Cloudflare KV storage, ensuring consistency across all worker instances.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Wrangler CLI
- Cloudflare account with Workers and KV enabled

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/7a6163/1min-relay-worker.git
cd 1min-relay-worker
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables in `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"vars": {
  "ONE_MIN_CHAT_API_URL": "https://api.1min.ai/api/chat-with-ai",
  "ONE_MIN_API_URL": "https://api.1min.ai/api/features",
  "ONE_MIN_ASSET_URL": "https://api.1min.ai/api/assets",
  "ONE_MIN_MODELS_API_URL": "https://api.1min.ai/models"
}
```

4. Create KV namespaces:

```bash
wrangler kv:namespace create "RATE_LIMIT_STORE"
wrangler kv:namespace create "MODEL_CACHE"
```

5. After running the commands above, you'll receive a KV namespace ID for each. Copy the IDs and update `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"kv_namespaces": [
  {
    "binding": "RATE_LIMIT_STORE",
    "id": "your-rate-limit-kv-id-here"
  },
  {
    "binding": "MODEL_CACHE",
    "id": "your-model-cache-kv-id-here"
  }
]
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Deployment

#### Quick Deployment

The fastest way to deploy is using the Cloudflare Deploy button at the top of this README:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/7a6163/1min-relay-worker)

#### Manual Deployment

1. Make sure you've completed all the setup steps above, including creating and configuring the KV namespace.

2. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

4. After successful deployment, you'll receive a URL for your worker (typically `https://1min-relay.your-subdomain.workers.dev`).

#### Custom Domain Configuration

To use a custom domain with your worker:

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard.

2. Navigate to the Workers & Pages section.

3. Select your deployed worker.

4. Click on "Triggers" tab.

5. Under "Custom Domains", click "Add Custom Domain" and follow the instructions.

#### Deployment Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. **Authentication errors**: Run `wrangler login` to authenticate with your Cloudflare account.

2. **KV binding errors**: Ensure your KV namespace is correctly configured in `wrangler.jsonc`.

3. **Build errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`.

4. **Rate limit errors**: If you're hitting Cloudflare's deployment rate limits, wait a few minutes before trying again.

5. **Environment variable issues**: Verify all required environment variables are set in `wrangler.jsonc`.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are configured in `wrangler.jsonc`:

- `ONE_MIN_CHAT_API_URL`: 1min.ai unified chat endpoint (`/api/chat-with-ai`)
- `ONE_MIN_API_URL`: 1min.ai features endpoint for non-chat features like image generation (`/api/features`)
- `ONE_MIN_ASSET_URL`: 1min.ai asset upload endpoint
- `ONE_MIN_MODELS_API_URL`: 1min.ai models API endpoint (for dynamic model list)

### KV Namespaces

- `RATE_LIMIT_STORE`: Used for distributed rate limiting storage
- `MODEL_CACHE`: Used for caching model data fetched from the 1min.ai API (1 hour TTL)

  -F "response_format=text"
```

### Streaming Chat

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \

    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a story"}],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

## Architecture

The worker is built with:

- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Serverless edge computing platform
- **Cloudflare KV**: Distributed key-value storage for rate limiting and model data caching
- **gpt-tokenizer**: Accurate token counting for all supported models

## Rate Limiting Implementation

The distributed rate limiting system:

1. Uses IP address + endpoint as the key
2. Tracks both request count and token count per minute
3. Stores data in Cloudflare KV with TTL
4. Returns proper HTTP 429 responses with rate limit headers
5. Ensures consistency across all worker instances globally

## Token Counting

Accurate token counting is implemented using the `gpt-tokenizer` library, which provides good approximations for all supported models including GPT, Claude, Mistral, and others. A character-based fallback is used if tokenization fails.
